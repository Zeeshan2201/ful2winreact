# Production Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Identified:
1. Server error (500) when registering for tournaments
2. Frontend and backend environment mismatch
3. Possible missing tournaments in production database

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed logging to tournament registration
- Added authentication middleware logging
- Added global error handler

### 2. Database Setup
- Created sample tournament creation endpoint
- Added health check endpoint
- Enhanced error messages

### 3. CORS Configuration
- Updated CORS to support production URLs
- Added flexible environment detection

## Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Update Production Backend
1. Deploy the updated backend code to: `https://ful2winreact.onrender.com`
2. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
3. Test health check: `GET https://ful2winreact.onrender.com/api/health`

### Step 2: Create Sample Tournaments
After deploying backend, create sample tournaments:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ful2winreact.onrender.com/api/tournaments/dev/create-samples"
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend
1. Deploy updated frontend to: `https://ful2win-u83b.onrender.com`
2. Verify environment detection is working
3. Test tournament registration flow

### Step 4: Verify FlappyBall Game Integration
1. Update script.js on flappyballgame.boostnow.in with production-script.js content
2. Test complete tournament flow:
   - Register for tournament
   - Play game
   - Submit score
   - View leaderboard

## Testing Checklist:

### Backend Tests:
- [ ] Health check: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] Get tournaments: `GET /api/tournaments`
- [ ] Create samples: `POST /api/tournaments/dev/create-samples`
- [ ] Tournament registration with auth

### Frontend Tests:
- [ ] Environment detection working
- [ ] API calls using correct URLs
- [ ] Tournament page loads
- [ ] Registration works
- [ ] Game modal opens
- [ ] Score submission works

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Hosted game receives tournament params
- [ ] Score submission from game to backend
- [ ] Leaderboard updates in real-time
- [ ] Cross-origin messaging works

## URLs to Test:

### Local:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:5000
- Health: http://localhost:5000/api/health

### Production:
- Frontend: https://ful2win-u83b.onrender.com
- Backend: https://ful2winreact.onrender.com
- Health: https://ful2winreact.onrender.com/api/health
- Game: https://flappyballgame.boostnow.in

## Environment Variables Needed:

### Backend (.env):
```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

### Frontend:
- No additional env vars needed (uses automatic detection)

## Troubleshooting:

### If tournaments don't exist:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ful2winreact.onrender.com/api/tournaments/dev/create-samples"
```

### If CORS errors:
- Check backend CORS configuration includes frontend URL
- Verify backend is deployed and accessible

### If authentication fails:
- Check JWT token format
- Verify authMiddleware is working
- Check user exists in database

### If score submission fails:
- Verify tournament exists
- Check user is registered for tournament
- Verify API URL in game parameters

## Production Script for Hosted Game:
Replace script.js content with production-script.js for full integration.
